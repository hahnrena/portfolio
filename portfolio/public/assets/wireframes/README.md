# Wireframe Images

Place your wireframe images in this directory with the following filenames:

- `promotions-user-flow.png` - User flow diagram showing the complete flow from entry point through auto-save
- `promotions-main-dashboard.png` - Main dashboard wireframe showing clinical terms list
- `promotions-expanded-view.png` - Expanded view wireframe showing promoted providers
- `promotions-add-provider-modal.png` - Modal wireframe for adding providers
- `promotions-empty-state.png` - Empty state wireframe
- `promotions-design-decisions.png` - Design decisions sticky notes

## Converting HTML Wireframes to Images

If you have the HTML wireframe file (`promotions-wireframes-userflow.html`), you can:

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Take screenshots of each section:
   - User Flow section
   - Each wireframe screen (Main Dashboard, Expanded View, Modal, Empty State)
   - Design Decisions sticky notes section
3. Save them with the filenames above

Alternatively, you can use browser developer tools or a tool like Puppeteer to programmatically convert the HTML to images.
